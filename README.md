# AgenticLearning

## Introduction

Agent exhibits powerful capabilities by interacting with the external environment and making decisions based on the feedback it receives from the environment.
For complex problems, it is often necessary for an agent to have multi-turn interactions with the environment to reach a solution. The complexity and dynamism of environments, coupled with the necessity for multi-turn interactions, pose numerous challenges in training agents.

We introduce **AgenticLearning**, an open-source agent training paradigm designed to empower researchers to train and evaluate autonomous agents effectively. AgenticLearning offers a framework for multi-turn interactions with the environment, enabling models to learn how to interact with the environment and make decisions based on its feedback, thereby enhancing the models' ability to leverage the environment to solve complex problems.

## News

[2025/07/01] ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥[**RAG-R1**](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AgenticLearning/blob/main/RAG-R1/README.md) We propose **RAG-R1**, a deepsearch training framework that incentivizing the search and reasoning capabilities of LLMs through multi-query parallelism.

[2025/05/16] ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥[**FunReason**](https://github.com/BingguangHao/FunReason/) We propose **FunReason**, a novel framework that enhances LLMs' function calling capabilities through an automated data refinement strategy and a Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss approach.

## Advancements

### Deepsearch

#### [RAG-R1](RAG-R1/README.md)

- Environment: Search Engines (offline or [online](https://github.com/qingw-dev/aworld-mcp-servers))
- LLM: Qwen2.5-7b-instruct
- Algorithm: SFT + RL(PPO)

<h5 align="left">Performance comparisons on QA benchmarks under the EM metric. The best and second
best results are bold and underlined, respectively.</h5>

### FunctionCall

#### [FunReason](https://github.com/BingguangHao/FunReason/)

- environment: Real Human Function calling (BFCLv2 live&non-live)
- LLM: Qwen2.5-7b-Coder-instruct

FunReason is a framework designed to enhance LLMs' function calling capabilities, achieving GPT-4o-comparable performance on BFCL, surpassing RL-based methods, mitigating catastrophic forgetting on HumanEval and MBPP, and using a data refinement strategy where natural CoT data outperforms artificial ones.

**Overview of FunReason's data refinement pipeline.** The pipeline consists of five stages: Function Call Classification, Query and Tool Identification, CoT Identification, Function and Parameter Identification, and Format Identification. Each stage ensures specific aspects of data quality, with failing examples either being discarded or regenerated.
