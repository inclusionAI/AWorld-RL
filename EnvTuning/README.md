## üéâ News

* [2025/10/25] We release the code.

* [2025/10/10] We propose **Environment Tuning**, a novel training paradigm that enables agents to learn complex multi-turn tool use behaviors through environmental interaction rather than trajectory imitation, achieving significant improvements with only 400 training samples.

## üìñ Introduction

Training agents for complex multi-turn tool-use is fundamentally constrained by three issues: the extreme scarcity of high-quality training data, the overfitting tendency of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic trajectories, and the cold-start instability of standard RL methods (e.g., GRPO). To overcome these roadblocks, we introduce Environment Tuning ‚Äî a training paradigm that teaches agents to learn robust behaviors by interacting with the environment rather than imitating fixed trajectories, especially under data-scarce regimes.

Our method is simple yet effective: we design a curriculum that moves from format understanding to real-world alignment, convert ambiguous failures into actionable guidance, and densify credit assignment across turns and states so the agent can tell ‚Äúalmost correct‚Äù from ‚Äúcompletely wrong‚Äù.

- Four-stage curriculum: start with syntax and calling conventions, scale to complex scenarios, and finally align under realistic evaluation conditions.
- Actionable environment augmentation: turn vague failures into correctable hints (e.g., missing parameters, tool dependency ordering), so failures become learning signals.
- Fine-grained progress rewards: dense feedback by turn and by execution outcome, avoiding sparse binary rewards and enabling steady improvement.

With only 400 training instances, Environment Tuning delivers significant gains on BFCL V3. For example, Qwen2.5-7B improves from 7.0% to 36.9%, and watt-tool-8B from 35.7% to 54.3%.

Beyond in-distribution settings, Environment Tuning generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks (e.g., BFCL V4, ACEBench). Notably, Llama-3.1-8B on Web Search improves from 1.0% to 15.0%. We also observe that even models previously overfitted by SFT can regain practical robustness on OOD tasks after training with our method.

Ablations confirm the necessity of both actionable augmentation and fine-grained progress rewards ‚Äî removing either makes hard splits dramatically harder to improve.

We also observe that removing the multi-stage curriculum (i.e., training with a single-stage RL pipeline) leads to unstable training, frequent collapses, and only limited gains compared to our curriculum design.

## ‚ú® Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

First, ensure you have a suitable Python environment (Python 3.10 recommended) and CUDA environment. We use the same dependencies as [verl v0.4.1](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/v0.4.1). You could follow the [installation guide](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.1/start/install.html) to install the dependencies.

### 2. Install verl Framework

Initialize and download the our [adapted verl submodule](https://github.com/ZechuanWang/verl):

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Navigate to verl directory and install it:

```bash
cd verl
pip install -e '.[sglang]'
```

If you encounter dependency issues, try:
```bash
cd verl
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or install sglang related dependencies
pip install -r requirements_sglang.txt
```

### 3. Configure Model and Data Paths

Before running training scripts, you need to modify the following configurations:

1. **Modify Model Path**: Edit the `MODEL` variable in training scripts
   ```bash
   # Find this line in the script and modify it to your model path
   MODEL="/your/local/model/path"
   ```

2. **Prepare Data**: Due to company policy, we cannot open-source the processed data. However, we provide the prompt template in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10197). We generated data in the following format compatible with verl training:

   ```python
   verl_entry = {
      "data_source": dataset_type,  # Mark the specific dataset type
      "prompt": [
         {
               "role": "system",
               "content": system_prompt
         },
         {
               "role": "user", 
               "content": first_question
         }
      ],
      "ability": "multi_turn_function_calling",
      "reward_model": {
         "style": "interaction", 
         # "interaction_type": "multi_turn_vm",
         "ground_truth": ground_truth  # Ground truth function sequence
      },
      "extra_info": {
         "split": "train",  # Will be overridden based on the split
         "index": entry.get("id", "unknown"),
         "original_id": entry.get("id", "unknown"),
         "dataset_type": dataset_type,  # Additional dataset type info
         # Serialize complex objects as JSON strings to avoid parquet issues
         "interaction_kwargs": {
               "name": "multi_turn_tool_call",
               "id":id,
               "initial_config": json.dumps(entry.get("initial_config", {}),ensure_ascii=False),
               "involved_classes": involved_classes,
               "ground_truth": ground_truth,
               "processed_question": processed_questions,  # Processed question turns with missed function prompts
               "question":entry.get("question")
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   Besides adding prompts, we did not perform additional processing. We simply sampled half of each split from [BFCL V3 Multi-Turn](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/tree/main/berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/bfcl_eval/data) as the training set, with the remaining portion used as the test set.

**Required Data Files**:
   - `data/train_format_75.parquet` (Stage 1)
   - `data/bfcl_train_base.parquet` (Stage 2)
   - `data/bfcl_train.parquet` (Stage 3 & 4)
   - `data/bfcl_val.parquet` (validation set)

### 4. Run Training

Execute training scripts for each stage from the scripts directory:

```bash
# Stage 1 training (basic format training)
bash scripts/run_multi_turn_fc_grpo_stage1.sh

# Stage 2 training (basic capability training)
bash scripts/run_multi_turn_fc_grpo_stage2.sh

# Stage 3 training (complete data training)
bash scripts/run_multi_turn_fc_grpo_stage3.sh
```


## üîß Customization

### Modify Training Parameters
Edit YAML configuration files in the `env_tuning/config/` directory to adjust training parameters.

### Custom Reward Functions
Modify `env_tuning/format_reward.py` or `env_tuning/bfcl_reward.py` to implement custom reward calculation logic.

### Adjust Multi-turn Interaction
Edit `env_tuning/config/multi_turn_fc_interaction_config.yaml` to configure multi-turn interaction parameters.
